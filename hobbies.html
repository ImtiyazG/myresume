    <h1>My Favorite Hobbies</h1>

    <ol>
      <h2><li>Reading Books</li></h2>
      <p>
        Reading books is one of my favorite hobbies and top on the list as its
        keeps me educated on new things and I improve a lot of my concentration
        and other skill. From novels to subject related books, I read them all
      </p>

      <h2><li>Solo Travelling</li></h2>
      <p>
        When life is boring or whenever I need to take a rest, I travel solo.
        This makes me wonder the purpose of life and set my life goals
        accordingly. When I do solo travel, I set my life priorities right. I
        also like to stay by the sea and look at the never-ending waves
      </p>

      <h2><li>Watching Movies</li></h2>
      <p>
        Movies have always taught me several things in life. From knowledge to
        strategy to facing risks, I have leant many a thing from movies.
      </p>

      <h2><li>Swimming</li></h2>
      <p>
        I try to swim whenever I can. It keeps the body cool and is a lot better
        than workout at the gym as you feel the entire body trying to break
        through the water and makes you sweat.
      </p>

      <h2><li>Sleeping</li></h2>
      <p>
        I don't really know if someone else has this as a hooby but I take
        sleeping to a different level as a hobby. Not that I am a lazy person
        but I do allocate sometime to a deep sleep. This makes my day clear and
        my thought fresh.
